Statement has side effects, no return, Expression returns a value

Statement - print Expression 5+7

3.
A. True
B. False
C. False
D. True
E. False

Operations only defines for specific data types.
len()
math for strings doest work

not a or (b or not(a and b))
a = true
b = false

True

SHORT CIRCUIT

x = 0
y = 2
z = 4

(x and y) or (y and z)

True, gives last thing that makes it true, so answer is 4

0 is false
any other number is true
